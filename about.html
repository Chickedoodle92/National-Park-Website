<p>Yellowstone National Park was established by Congress on March 1, 1872, as the first national park, marking the start of the global national park movement. Initially, various federal agencies managed different parklands, leading to fragmented oversight. To address this, the National Park Service (NPS) was created on August 25, 1916, to unify the management of U.S. national parks and monuments.
A significant expansion occurred in 1933, when an Executive Order transferred additional sites to the NPS, moving toward a unified system. The General Authorities Act of 1970 further affirmed the goal of managing all national parklands under a single framework.
Today, the National Park System includes over 400 sites across all U.S. states and territories, covering more than 84 million acres. New parks are usually created by Congress, with the President able to designate national monuments via the Antiquities Act of 1906.
The NPS's mission has expanded beyond conservation to include cultural preservation, community engagement, and global conservation efforts. Over 20,000 NPS employees now help protect these resources and improve public access to nature and history.</p>
